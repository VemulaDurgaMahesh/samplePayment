Yellow Leaf Hammocks does an amazing job of telling you about its product by describing how the hammocks empower artisan weavers and their families.<br><br> The company uses a combination of words and easily digestible graphics to paint a picture, rather than using big chunks of text. They're clear about why they're different:<br><br> "Not a Charity," the page reads. And then: "This is the basis for a brighter future, built on a hand up, not a handout."
